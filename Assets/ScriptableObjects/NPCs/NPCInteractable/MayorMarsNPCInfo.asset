    - Robert and I have had an ongoing professional relationship for many years now.
    - He was running for mayor in this upcoming election.

      for.
  - textLines:
    - Why I was in the study 'miring his collection.
    - He and I... shared many interests I have found.
  - textLines:
    - I-I love to play golf with my sponsors.
