  description: A folder containing polaroid images of what appears to be Robert Jupiter
    entering a known strip club. The dates are circles in red indicating this was
    one year following the passing of the Mrs.Jupiter... There are multiple vaugley
    threatening notes on the back of the photos, very neatly written if it weren't
    for the lack of periods. They all boil down to the simple message "You know what
    I want Robert, It would be a shame if these photos were to get out."
