  description: A gruff voice comes from the compact device when you hit play. "Seems
    like the uh, Jupiter business is tangled up in a drug ring. The evidence is undeniable.
    Now I'm not usually one to hold sebtimental feelings, but the Jupiter I know
    wouldn't be involved with something like this. Maybe he's changed. Or maybe this
    is all happening under his nose... No Pun intended. Anyway, this bust was my
    last lead, next best step is to pay a visit to Jupiter, measure his reaction...
    Hopefully, this will be quite a suprise to him."
