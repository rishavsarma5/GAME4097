  description: This menu boasts a list of class and high-caliber food. It appears
    to be an ealrly draft because written neatly in the margins is the note, "Please
    take note, the Lancier Grand Cru will only be served to the guests. The Roux
    Sauvignon will be reserved for the family - Ganymede"
